# Anomaly Detection For IoT Devices
This project is part of my capstone project at The University of Sydney.
The repo has three folders: Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering and Anomaly Detection.
The data used as part of this project can be downloaded from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT

For feature extraction the author used the following algorithm:<br />
Y. Mirsky, T. Doitshman, Y. Elovici & A. Shabtai, 'Kitsune: An Ensemble of Autoencoders for Online Network Intrusion Detection', in Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium, San Diego (2018), CA, USA.
